**Print files from outside of the app** 

This app supports a "open with" functionality. If you want to print files on your cloud drive like google drive or dropbox, you can open the file on your drive through OSU PrintingHelper. Once open, choose the account you want to use(This popup window will not show up if a account is already running or you only have one account). After this OSU PrintingHelper will automatically load the file on the background. Then make your choice of print configuration and a simple click on the print button will request the printer to print the file for you.
